# internode.py

Python package for retrieving your Internode account information and usage and additional script to output these as JSON or CSV files.

## Setup

Install the required packages with _pip_. [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is highly recommended.

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

To write your own script to handle your account information, you can
simply import the `internode` package and interact with the classes directly.

## Example Scripts

Two scripts have been provided to help you your account information and usage history.

- `export.py` exports account information and usage as individual JSON files.
- `export_csv.py` exports usage as individual CSV files.

#### JSON

Add your username and password to `export.py` by replacing the `USERNAME` and
`PASSWORD` variables with your Internode account details (do not include
`@internode.on.net`), then execute by running `python export.py`.

- Each service tied to your account is output as a JSON file, named after your
service ID. i.e. `1234567.json`.
- An additional JSON file, `account.json`, is also generated that contains a list
of each of the aforementioned files.

By default, JSON files are output to the `data` directory in the script's
working-directory. If this directory does not exist, the script will attempt to
create it.

#### CSV

Add your username and password to `export_csv.py` by replacing the `USERNAME` and
`PASSWORD` variables with your Internode account details (do not include
`@internode.on.net`), then execute by running `python export_csv.py`.

## Properties

### `service` properties

These properties are retrived when calling `get_service()` on a `Service` instance. These properties are also output in each service's JSON file by `export.py`.

### `usage` properties

A small number of properties from the above table are output by calling `get_usage()` on a `Service` instance. These properties are also output in each service's JSON file by `export.py`.


## Units

All units are output as bytes.

Internode, like many ISPs, uses SI decimal values
â€” 1,000 bytes per kilobyte (instead of 1,024). To ensure your output matches your understanding of your service, please refer to the table below:

| Unit     | Bytes             |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| Kilobyte | 1,000             |
| Megabyte | 1,000,000         |
| Gigabyte | 1,000,000,000     |
| Terabyte | 1,000,000,000,000 |

## Wishlist

- Add in functionality detailed by the official API specification
- Python 2\3 compatibility
- Write tests (difficult currently since the API does not provide a dummy account for testing)
- A nice static site which can display the JSON output
